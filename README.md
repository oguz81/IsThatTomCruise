# IsThatTomCruise
A basic face recognition model to check whether it's Tom Cruise or not.

It is a study that I test myself to build a convolutional neural network from scratch and train it with the dataset I create. I first built the model with fully ReLu function. Then I switched to sigmoid in the last layer for binary classification. These two version of the model is in this repo. I am still working for fine tuning and adding new methods. 

I aimed to train the model with images and then expect that it can catch the face of Tom Cruise on videos. Actuallt it's not unsuccessful but not totally successfull. Maybe it needs better dataset for training or a better method for catching Tom's face on videos.
